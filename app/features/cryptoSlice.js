Instead, a network of thousands of peers is controlling the transactions; a decentralized system.</p>\n\n<h3>Why does bitcoin have value?</h3>\n\n<p>Bitcoin&rsquo;s useful qualities (decentralized, borderless, secure) aren&rsquo;t the only reason the coin is worth so much. Due to its scarcity (and it&rsquo;s hard to produce), Bitcoin is often nicknamed &lsquo;Digital Gold&rsquo;, in reference to &lsquo;classic&rsquo; physical gold. Like gold, Bitcoin also has a finite supply of coins available; there will only ever be 21 million bitcoin. And now you know why the creation of new bitcoins is also called mining.</p>\n\n<h3>No inflation in bitcoin</h3>\n\n<p>Bitcoin was invented in response to a few concerns the inventor(s) had, such as inflation. Its supply is limited, so one cannot just devalue the currency by printing more, as governments often do with fiat currencies (USD, EUR, etc.).</p>\n\n<p>As people look for alternative places to keep their money rather than losing value in a negative interest rate account, Bitcoin becomes more appealing. Big global companies, such as Tesla and MicroStrategy already purchased serious amounts of Bitcoin. And it&#39;s only a matter of time that other companies will follow. This also ensures that the value remains or continues to increase.</p>\n\n<h3>Who built Bitcoin</h3>\n\n<p>In 2008, Bitcoin was invented by an anonymous person or group named Satoshi Nakamoto. In 2009, Bitcoin was released as open-source software. Nakamoto&rsquo;s real identity is still unknown, although there are many theories about who it might be. Decentralization is one of Bitcoin&rsquo;s most important principles, and that&rsquo;s why this anonymity is perfectly in line.</p>\n\n<h3>The technology of Bitcoin</h3>\n\n<p>The Bitcoin blockchain is a database, the so-called &lsquo;ledger&rsquo;, that consists of bitcoin transaction records. For new transactions to be added to the ledger, the nodes must agree that the transaction is real and valid. The blockchain is public and contains records of all the transactions taking place.</p>\n\n<h3>How to buy bitcoin?</h3>\n\n<p>Continue reading <a href=\"https://coinranking.com/blog/how-to-buy-your-first-bitcoin/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">this blog article</a> on how to buy your first bitcoin.</p>\n", "color": "#f7931A", "iconType": "vector", "iconUrl": "https://cdn.coinranking.com/bOabBYkcX/bitcoin_btc.svg", "websiteUrl": "https://bitcoin.org", "socials": [{ "name": "r/bitcoin", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/bitcoin/", "type": "reddit" }, { "name": "bitcoin/bitcoin", "url": "https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin", "type": "github" }], "links": [{ "name": "bitcoin.org", "type": "website", "url": "https://bitcoin.org" }, { "name": "Bitcoin Whitepaper", "url": "https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf", "type": "website" }, { "name": "bitcoinmagazine.com", "url": "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/", "type": "website" }, { "name": "BitcoinTalk", "url": "https://bitcointalk.org/", "type": "bitcointalk" }, { "name": "blockchain.com", "url": "https://www.blockchain.com/explorer", "type": "explorer" }, { "name": "bitcoin/bitcoin", "url": "https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin", "type": "github" }, { "name": "r/bitcoin", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/bitcoin/", "type": "reddit" }, { "name": "Bitcoin_Magazine", "url": "https://t.me/Bitcoin_Magazine", "type": "telegram" }, { "name": "bitcoin", "url": "https://t.me/bitcoin", "type": "telegram" }], "confirmedSupply": true, "numberOfMarkets": 21649, "numberOfExchanges": 346, "type": "coin", "volume": 43155186035, "marketCap": 1027516675788, "price": "54547.6428521451", "circulatingSupply": 18837050, "totalSupply": 18837050, "approvedSupply": true, "firstSeen": 1330214400000, "listedAt": 1330214400, "change": 7.59, "rank": 1, "history": ["50700.6954522956", "50677.9901689542", "50773.9934679302", "51350.3133777357", "51462.3769069814", "52976.3982165283", "54147.99218563", "54353.8617367702", "54806.4742548524", "54674.9658396058", "54622.766419943", "54781.8773661405", "54816.8514641263", "55098.5228512704", "55095.2248164471", "55073.2774157892", "55366.7435269091", "54936.5189563584", "54612.9620862336", "54942.5301156278", "54966.277632704", "54999.4918720934", "54812.1335954041", "54714.8164010037", "54506.1009883554", "54590.874222444", "54547.6428521451"], "allTimeHigh": { "price": "64185.10833403135", "timestamp": 1618358400000 }, "penalty": false }, { "id": 2, "uuid": "razxDUgYGNAdQ", "slug": "ethereum-eth", "symbol": "ETH", "name": "Ethereum", "description": "<p>Ethereum (ETH) is a global, public decentralized blockchain designed to run peer-to-peer smart contracts.

In 2014, Buterin and the other co-founders launched a campaign where they sold ether (Ethereum tokens) to raise money to build their vision.

The HEX smart contract penalizes stakers for ending their stake early and rewards them for staking larger amounts of HEX for longer periods. HEX is distributed to Bitcoin holders by way of a snapshot of the Bitcoin UTXO set that occurred on 2 December 2019 at block height 606227. The distribution of HEX to Bitcoin holders is 10,000 HEX per 1 BTC. Bitcoin holders are able to claim HEX only during the first year of launch. During this period, HEX is also obtained in exchange for ETH through interacting with the HEX smart contract. At the end of the first year of launch, all HEX coins that were not claimed by Bitcoin holders are distributed to the rest of the HEX users who have stakes that are active. The maximum possible annual inflation of HEX is designed to be 3.69% after the first year of launch.</p>", "color": "#ffcd00", "iconType": "vector", "iconUrl": "https://cdn.coinranking.com/iseN4Am58/hex-vector.svg", "websiteUrl": null, "socials": [], "links": [{ "name": "hex.com", "url": "https://hex.com/", "type": "website" }, { "name": "HEXCrypto", "url": "https://twitter.com/HEXCrypto", "type": "twitter" }, { "name": "HEXcrypto", "url": "https://t.me/HEXcrypto", "type": "telegram" }, { "name": "hexcrypto", "url": "https://hexcrypto.reddit.com/", "type": "reddit" }, { "name": "Discord", "url": "https://discord.gg/CA8jVuF", "type": "discord" }, { "name": "HexCrypto", "url": "https://youtube.com/HexCrypto?sub_confirmation=1", "type": "youtube" }, { "name": "HEXcrypto", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/HEXcrypto", "type": "facebook" }, { "name": "HEXcrypto", "url": "https://www.instagram.com/HEXcrypto", "type": "instagram" }, { "name": "bitcoinHEX", "url": "https://github.com/bitcoinHEX", "type": "github" }], "confirmedSupply": true, "numberOfMarkets": 51, "numberOfExchanges": 24, "type": "coin", "volume": 29636484, "marketCap": 104554576417, "price": "0.4046093931", "circulatingSupply": 258408673171.1115, "totalSupply": 634026624101.8873, "approvedSupply": true, "firstSeen": 1589361480000, "listedAt": 1589361480, "change": 7.06, "rank": 3, "history": ["0.3779226969", "0.3784583465", "0.3794417325", "0.3845229612", "0.384262605", "0.3827957064", "0.3781749188", "0.3768489162", "0.3728431586", "0.3715209312", "0.3718207619", "0.3688683241", "0.3688768501", "0.3693746164", "0.3689065686", "0.3719602159", "0.3758258581", "0.3786954184", "0.3812427634", "0.3811312961", "0.3816470712", "0.3822656533", "0.3802398586", "0.3802965174", "0.3832091293", "0.3873925081", "0.4046093931"], "allTimeHigh": { "price": "0.48617926661728855", "timestamp": 1632009600000 }, "penalty": false }, { "id": 9, "uuid": "qzawljRxB5bYu", "slug": "cardano-ada", "symbol": "ADA", "name": "Cardano", "description": "<p>Cardano (ADA) is a decentralised public blockchain and cryptocurrency project and is fully open source.

It uses a proof of stake consensus mechanism with a low barrier to entry along with timestamped transactions to maximize efficiency.This allows Solana to process 50-65 000 transactions per second with a theoretical limit of over 700 00 transactions per second (compared to Bitcoin&rsquo;s 7 TPS and Ethereum&rsquo;s 15 TPS). In contrast to other similar projects such as&nbsp;Polkadot.<br />\nThe team at Solana has designed their blockchain with a long-term vision in mind. This comes from founder Anatoly Yakovenko&rsquo;s own experience watching telecommunications technologies almost double in capability every year during his time at Qualcomm.<br />\nSolana is developed by a company of the same name which is based in San Diego, California. The Solana team consists of former Qualcomm, Google, Apple, Microsoft, and Dropbox employees. In addition to being based on similar database technologies used by Google and Microsoft, Solana&rsquo;s architecture is also inspired by&nbsp;Filecoin, a decentralized data storage cryptocurrency project.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>How does Solana Work?</strong><br />\n<br />\nDisclaimer: Solana is incredibly complex. Start with a term you may have heard if you have looked at the project before:&nbsp;Proof of History&nbsp;(PoH). PoH is not a consensus mechanism. Rather, it is a component in Solana&rsquo;s Proof of Stake consensus. PoH involves timestamping transactions when they are added to a Solana block. A new block on Solana is generated every 400ms (compared to Ethereum&rsquo;s roughly 15 seconds and Bitcoin&rsquo;s 10 minutes).Without getting into too much detail, the&nbsp;decentralized clock&nbsp;which is used as reference for the timestamps is the SHA256 hash function. SHA256 may sound familiar because it is used in Bitcoin&rsquo;s Proof of Work consensus mechanism. However, instead of working to &ldquo;solve&rdquo; the hash functions to produce a new block, Solana instead uses SHA256&rsquo;s repetitive outputs as reference &ndash; timestamps. This produces a sort of &ldquo;clock tick&rdquo; where each clock tick is 400ms (instead of one second like a regular clock).<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n", "color": null, "iconType": "vector", "iconUrl": "https://cdn.coinranking.com/yvUG4Qex5/solana.svg", "websiteUrl": null, "socials": [], "links": [{ "name": "solana.com", "url": "https://solana.com/", "type": "website" }, { "name": "explorer.solana.com", "url": "http://explorer.solana.com/", "type": "explorer" }, { "name": "Discord", "url": "https://discordapp.com/invite/pquxPsq", "type": "discord" }, { "name": "solana-labs", "url": "https://github.com/solana-labs/", "type": "github" }, { "name": "solana-labs", "url": "https://medium.com/solana-labs", "type": "medium" }, { "name": "solana", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/solana/", "type": "reddit" }, { "name": "SolanaNews", "url": "https://weibo.com/SolanaNews", "type": "sina-weibo" }, { "name": "solanaio", "url": "https://t.me/solanaio", "type": "telegram" }, { "name": "solana", "url": "https://twitter.com/solana", "type": "twitter" }, { "name": "solanarus", "url": "https://vk.com/solanarus", "type": "vkontakte" }, { "name": "solanalabs", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/c/solanalabs", "type": "youtube" }], "confirmedSupply": true, "numberOfMarkets": 102, "numberOfExchanges": 51, "type": "coin", "volume": 2947115914, "marketCap": 47103342557, "price": "158.0710823094", "circulatingSupply": 297988359.8473995, "totalSupply": 505734926.92323107, "approvedSupply": true, "firstSeen": 1586539320000, "listedAt": 1586539320, "change": 3.56, "rank": 8, "history": ["152.6352781484", "152.5022412505", "153.9001704222", "154.7607713214", "153.5297627581", "156.6365288166", "159.0424927729", "159.2716087786", "160.00993367", "159.8637873781", "159.4485494842", "159.6090026105", "159.6861376641", "156.2973147064", "154.4544018277", "154.2764265701", "154.2975684997", "153.533466483", "151.8838683196", "153.1573893761", "152.5798533913", "153.6378085097", "154.8753480472", "155.3865746451", "154.3440718029", "158.0358302906", "158.0710823094"], "allTimeHigh": { "price": "190.31617106614786", "timestamp": 1631145600000 }, "penalty": false }, { "id": 62458, "uuid": "AaQUAs2Mc", "slug": "terra-luna", "symbol": "LUNA*", "name": "Terra", "description": "<p>Terra is a price-stable cryptocurrency aimed at mass adoption.

The price of each litecoin is cheaper than bitcoin, and transactions are easier, because there are more Litecoins that can be created by mining. Litecoin is often referred to ‘silver’, whilst Bitcoin is compared with ‘gold.’</p>\n<h3>Who started Litecoin</h3>\n<p>In October 2011, litecoin was released via an open-source client on GitHub.

The team includes two PhDs in CS &amp; AI, multiple math, CS, and AI Olympiad champions, and a former member of the NEM core team.</p>\n", "color": "#000000", "iconType": "vector", "iconUrl": "https://cdn.coinranking.com/X62ruAuZQ/Elrond.svg", "websiteUrl": null, "socials": [], "links": [{ "name": "elrond.com", "url": "https://elrond.com/", "type": "website" }, { "name": "ElrondNetwork", "url": "https://github.com/ElrondNetwork", "type": "github" }, { "name": "reddit.com", "url": "https://reddit.com/r/elrondnetwork", "type": "reddit" }, { "name": "ElrondNetwork", "url": "https://t.me/ElrondNetwork", "type": "telegram" }, { "name": "elrondnetwork", "url": "https://twitter.com/elrondnetwork", "type": "twitter" }], "confirmedSupply": true, "numberOfMarkets": 49, "numberOfExchanges": 28, "type": "coin", "volume": 152273974, "marketCap": 4170290958, "price": "239.1826419312", "circulatingSupply": 17435592, "totalSupply": 20397843, "approvedSupply": true, "firstSeen": 1612524044000, "listedAt": 1612524044, "change": 5.84, "rank": 40, "history": ["225.9820093238", "225.9131824561", "227.71791581", "229.8742249425", "229.8433215931", "232.5948906631", "238.7204007417", "239.5941475575", "238.865609103", "236.4304192587", "236.8137317876", "236.5586325653", "235.5381001278", "232.3790504854", "230.4607740939", "230.9691305006", "230.5071146237", "227.9317426594", "227.0456805058", "229.2092334253", "228.8356357214", "230.8191447943", "233.9978906427", "234.9834863103", "233.9811110783", "239.0332980949", "239.1826419312"], "allTimeHigh": { "price": "281.007972239692", "timestamp": 1631664000000 }, "penalty": false }, { "id": 74883, "uuid": "ixgUfzmLR", "slug": "aave-aave", "symbol": "AAVE", "name": "Aave", "description": "<p>Aave is a decentralised non-custodial liquidity market protocol where users can participate as depositors or borrowers.
