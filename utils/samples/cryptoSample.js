Instead, a network of thousands of peers is controlling the transactions; a decentralized system.</p>\n\n<h3>Why does bitcoin have value?</h3>\n\n<p>Bitcoin&rsquo;s useful qualities (decentralized, borderless, secure) aren&rsquo;t the only reason the coin is worth so much. Due to its scarcity (and it&rsquo;s hard to produce), Bitcoin is often nicknamed &lsquo;Digital Gold&rsquo;, in reference to &lsquo;classic&rsquo; physical gold. Like gold, Bitcoin also has a finite supply of coins available; there will only ever be 21 million bitcoin. And now you know why the creation of new bitcoins is also called mining.</p>\n\n<h3>No inflation in bitcoin</h3>\n\n<p>Bitcoin was invented in response to a few concerns the inventor(s) had, such as inflation. Its supply is limited, so one cannot just devalue the currency by printing more, as governments often do with fiat currencies (USD, EUR, etc.).</p>\n\n<p>As people look for alternative places to keep their money rather than losing value in a negative interest rate account, Bitcoin becomes more appealing. Big global companies, such as Tesla and MicroStrategy already purchased serious amounts of Bitcoin. And it&#39;s only a matter of time that other companies will follow. This also ensures that the value remains or continues to increase.</p>\n\n<h3>Who built Bitcoin</h3>\n\n<p>In 2008, Bitcoin was invented by an anonymous person or group named Satoshi Nakamoto. In 2009, Bitcoin was released as open-source software. Nakamoto&rsquo;s real identity is still unknown, although there are many theories about who it might be. Decentralization is one of Bitcoin&rsquo;s most important principles, and that&rsquo;s why this anonymity is perfectly in line.</p>\n\n<h3>The technology of Bitcoin</h3>\n\n<p>The Bitcoin blockchain is a database, the so-called &lsquo;ledger&rsquo;, that consists of bitcoin transaction records. For new transactions to be added to the ledger, the nodes must agree that the transaction is real and valid. The blockchain is public and contains records of all the transactions taking place.</p>\n\n<h3>How to buy bitcoin?</h3>\n\n<p>Continue reading <a href=\"https://coinranking.com/blog/how-to-buy-your-first-bitcoin/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">this blog article</a> on how to buy your first bitcoin.</p>\n","color":"#f7931A","iconType":"vector","iconUrl":"https://cdn.coinranking.com/bOabBYkcX/bitcoin_btc.svg","websiteUrl":"https://bitcoin.org","socials":[{"name":"r/bitcoin","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/bitcoin/","type":"reddit"},{"name":"bitcoin/bitcoin","url":"https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin","type":"github"}],"links":[{"name":"bitcoin.org","type":"website","url":"https://bitcoin.org"},{"name":"Bitcoin Whitepaper","url":"https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf","type":"website"},{"name":"bitcoinmagazine.com","url":"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/","type":"website"},{"name":"BitcoinTalk","url":"https://bitcointalk.org/","type":"bitcointalk"},{"name":"blockchain.com","url":"https://www.blockchain.com/explorer","type":"explorer"},{"name":"bitcoin/bitcoin","url":"https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin","type":"github"},{"name":"r/bitcoin","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/bitcoin/","type":"reddit"},{"name":"Bitcoin_Magazine","url":"https://t.me/Bitcoin_Magazine","type":"telegram"},{"name":"bitcoin","url":"https://t.me/bitcoin","type":"telegram"}],"confirmedSupply":true,"numberOfMarkets":21654,"numberOfExchanges":346,"type":"coin","volume":30902594554,"marketCap":1038609610218,"price":"55131.4101863005","circulatingSupply":18838800,"totalSupply":18838800,"approvedSupply":true,"firstSeen":1330214400000,"listedAt":1330214400,"change":-0.73,"rank":1,"history":["55534.0706009408","55319.8693310115","54831.057590422","54505.767129375","54491.0027586685","54385.866499885","54297.0402517187","54264.9666802105","54486.2834532728","54563.4375580533","54478.4995885293","54082.2649991129","54159.5213246445","54018.4313415778","54046.004413275","54091.9466805862","53997.4665056159","54264.6139030619","54594.990698147","54600.4824368665","54654.8033030268","54843.303714139","54892.4126972555","54668.8986677855","54761.8566965673","54796.5505292324","55131.4101863005"],"allTimeHigh":{"price":"64185.10833403135","timestamp":1618358400000},"penalty":false},{"id":2,"uuid":"razxDUgYGNAdQ","slug":"ethereum-eth","symbol":"ETH","name":"Ethereum","description":"<p>Ethereum (ETH) is a global, public decentralized blockchain designed to run peer-to-peer smart contracts.

It uses a proof of stake consensus mechanism with a low barrier to entry along with timestamped transactions to maximize efficiency.This allows Solana to process 50-65 000 transactions per second with a theoretical limit of over 700 00 transactions per second (compared to Bitcoin&rsquo;s 7 TPS and Ethereum&rsquo;s 15 TPS). In contrast to other similar projects such as&nbsp;Polkadot.<br />\nThe team at Solana has designed their blockchain with a long-term vision in mind. This comes from founder Anatoly Yakovenko&rsquo;s own experience watching telecommunications technologies almost double in capability every year during his time at Qualcomm.<br />\nSolana is developed by a company of the same name which is based in San Diego, California. The Solana team consists of former Qualcomm, Google, Apple, Microsoft, and Dropbox employees. In addition to being based on similar database technologies used by Google and Microsoft, Solana&rsquo;s architecture is also inspired by&nbsp;Filecoin, a decentralized data storage cryptocurrency project.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>How does Solana Work?</strong><br />\n<br />\nDisclaimer: Solana is incredibly complex. Start with a term you may have heard if you have looked at the project before:&nbsp;Proof of History&nbsp;(PoH). PoH is not a consensus mechanism. Rather, it is a component in Solana&rsquo;s Proof of Stake consensus. PoH involves timestamping transactions when they are added to a Solana block. A new block on Solana is generated every 400ms (compared to Ethereum&rsquo;s roughly 15 seconds and Bitcoin&rsquo;s 10 minutes).Without getting into too much detail, the&nbsp;decentralized clock&nbsp;which is used as reference for the timestamps is the SHA256 hash function. SHA256 may sound familiar because it is used in Bitcoin&rsquo;s Proof of Work consensus mechanism. However, instead of working to &ldquo;solve&rdquo; the hash functions to produce a new block, Solana instead uses SHA256&rsquo;s repetitive outputs as reference &ndash; timestamps. This produces a sort of &ldquo;clock tick&rdquo; where each clock tick is 400ms (instead of one second like a regular clock).<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n","color":null,"iconType":"vector","iconUrl":"https://cdn.coinranking.com/yvUG4Qex5/solana.svg","websiteUrl":null,"socials":[],"links":[{"name":"solana.com","url":"https://solana.com/","type":"website"},{"name":"explorer.solana.com","url":"http://explorer.solana.com/","type":"explorer"},{"name":"Discord","url":"https://discordapp.com/invite/pquxPsq","type":"discord"},{"name":"solana-labs","url":"https://github.com/solana-labs/","type":"github"},{"name":"solana-labs","url":"https://medium.com/solana-labs","type":"medium"},{"name":"solana","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/solana/","type":"reddit"},{"name":"SolanaNews","url":"https://weibo.com/SolanaNews","type":"sina-weibo"},{"name":"solanaio","url":"https://t.me/solanaio","type":"telegram"},{"name":"solana","url":"https://twitter.com/solana","type":"twitter"},{"name":"solanarus","url":"https://vk.com/solanarus","type":"vkontakte"},{"name":"solanalabs","url":"https://www.youtube.com/c/solanalabs","type":"youtube"}],"confirmedSupply":true,"numberOfMarkets":102,"numberOfExchanges":51,"type":"coin","volume":2088337649,"marketCap":47936329832,"price":"160.0940137143","circulatingSupply":299426122.93734336,"totalSupply":505939575.2778356,"approvedSupply":true,"firstSeen":1586539320000,"listedAt":1586539320,"change":-3.07,"rank":8,"history":["165.1604478158","163.572040851","163.1755616908","164.2180155578","167.0259754777","166.6160288757","166.5235221868","163.9891954127","164.6879210176","163.8613946747","162.2571732809","160.7551054486","161.0140777947","159.284193369","158.8687226693","158.3488553297","157.3677742583","158.5432063437","160.0820244","160.6318959422","159.9183977142","159.8565445716","159.6032865678","158.3962498395","158.9098287175","159.2328510949","160.0940137143"],"allTimeHigh":{"price":"190.31617106614786","timestamp":1631145600000},"penalty":false},{"id":62458,"uuid":"AaQUAs2Mc","slug":"terra-luna","symbol":"LUNA*","name":"Terra","description":"<p>Terra is a price-stable cryptocurrency aimed at mass adoption.

Tezos is designed to provide the code correctness and safety that is necessary for assets and other important use cases. Tezos has a so-called modular architecture, which refers to the design of a system composed of separate components that can be connected together. Together with its formal upgrade mechanism, Tezos&rsquo; allows the network to adopt and propose innovations very smoothly.

However, there were a few issues with Bytecoin, which lead to a group of seven developers to fork the Bytecoin blockchain. The new currency would be known as Bitmonero, later named Monero.

Later they found this fork wasn’t actually in line with this vision. Now there were two teams; Bitcoin ABC, the core team of Bitcoin Cash, and team nChain. Team nChain started Bitcoin SV, led by Craig Wright, who later claimed several times he is actually Satoshi Nakamoto.</p>","color":"#eab300","iconType":"vector","iconUrl":"https://cdn.coinranking.com/388ehh6kq/bitcoin-sv-1.svg","websiteUrl":"https://bitcoinsv.io/","socials":[{"name":"bitcoinsvnode","url":"https://twitter.com/bitcoinsvnode","type":"twitter"},{"name":"bitcoin-sv/bitcoin-sv","url":"https://github.com/bitcoin-sv/bitcoin-sv","type":"github"}],"links":[{"name":"bitcoinsv.io","type":"website","url":"https://bitcoinsv.io/"},{"name":"bitcoinsvnode","url":"https://twitter.com/bitcoinsvnode","type":"twitter"},{"name":"bitcoin-sv/bitcoin-sv","url":"https://github.com/bitcoin-sv/bitcoin-sv","type":"github"}],"confirmedSupply":true,"numberOfMarkets":344,"numberOfExchanges":111,"type":"coin","volume":407638160,"marketCap":3373958594,"price":"178.8556884744","circulatingSupply":18864139.14423905,"totalSupply":18864139.14423905,"approvedSupply":true,"firstSeen":1541808000000,"listedAt":1541808000,"change":-0.99,"rank":50,"history":["180.6395858479","179.5318205665","177.6777375579","176.6188745013","178.1633613862","178.3459138796","176.1576138301","176.2541754568","176.6910690632","176.3170884005","176.0663271681","174.0161156995","174.6873003898","175.2152495546","175.1819397426","174.7772295127","173.0724513457","172.5182813864","174.4780952359","175.3366593984","174.9033218545","174.8706061123","176.0407478619","176.517978409","177.3213659828","178.0077181602","178.8556884744"],"allTimeHigh":{"price":"422.299054097308","timestamp":1620259200000},"penalty":false}]}
